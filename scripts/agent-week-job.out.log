Do one video at a time: open the video, use the download/history link button, copy the direct download URL. Write each URL to C:\\Users\\vladi\\code\\text_to_voice\\learn_vids\\download_urls.txt as you go (append, one per line with the video title). Weeks to cover in order: March 2 - March 8; March 2 - March 8 (repeat); March 23 - March 29; March 30 - April 5; April 6 - April 12; April 13 - April 19; April 20 - April 26; April 27 - May 3. After collecting all URLs, download each MP4 to C:\\Users\\vladi\\code\\text_to_voice\\learn_vids, then run the mp4-to-mp3 conversion (existing extract script), then run transcription so that transcripts land in C:\\Users\\vladi\\code\\text_to_voice\\learn_vids\\transcripts. Keep monitoring progress with waits in a loop; do not stop until done. Assume you're already logged in. If a download fails, retry or refresh and continue.\r\n" "--agent" "main" "--timeout" "21600"

I can do the **browser part** (open each week/video and extract the **direct `download.cdn.hosted.panopto.com` URL**), but I **can’t** complete the rest as written because:

- Those paths (`C:\Users\vladi\code\...`) are on your **Windows host**, and my tools run in a **sandbox** that can’t write/download/run scripts on your host filesystem.
- “Download each MP4, run conversion script, run transcription, keep monitoring until done” would require **host execution** access.

What I *can* do right now:
1) Collect all direct download URLs from the requested weeks (one video at a time, using the logged-in browser session).
2) Append them to a file **in the sandbox workspace** (e.g. `download_urls.txt`) in the format: `Title<TAB>URL`, one per line.
3) Send you the completed list (and/or the file contents) so you can run downloads/conversion/transcription locally.

If you want the full pipeline automated on your Windows machine, pick one:
- **Option A:** Tell me a **sandbox path** to use instead (inside `C:\Users\vladi\.clawdbot\sandboxes\...`) and I’ll do everything in-sandbox.
- **Option B (recommended):** I’ll extract all URLs, then I’ll give you a **PowerShell command/script** that downloads to `C:\Users\vladi\code\text_to_voice\learn_vids`, runs your existing mp4→mp3 extract script, and runs transcription into `...\transcripts`.

Which option do you want?
